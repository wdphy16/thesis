Architectures of autoregressive neural networks (ARNN) for variational inference.
The spin configuration $\vs$ is the input to the network, $\hat{\vs}$ is the output of the network, and $h$ denotes hidden layer. The loss function $F_q$ is given by \cref{eq:fq}. The colored sites denote the receptive field of a site in $\hat{\vs}$.
(a) The network has only one layer, which is densely connected, while the autoregressive property hold.
(b) The network has a hidden layer.
(c) The network has masked convolution layers on 2D lattice. Only connections in a convolution kernel are shown for clarity.

The exact result (dashed line) at $T = 0$ and $L \to \infty$ is $S / N = 0.323066$~\cite{TODO}. The curves for $L = 8, 14, 16$ are almost overlapped.

\caption[ARNN results of Hopfield model]{
Log probability of sampled configurations of ARNN learned for a Hopfield model with $N = 100$ spins, and $P = 2$ orthogonal patterns, on the two-dimensional spaces spanned by two patterns. In the figures, the $x$- and the $y$-axes represent inner product (overlap) between each sampled configuration and the first and the second stored patterns respectively. Our network uses single layer and only $N (N - 1) / 2$ parameters. The top figures are 3D view of the meshed log probability surface, while the bottom figures are the 2D view from top. From left to right, $\beta$ values are $0.3$, $1.0$, and $1.5$ respectively.
